# rp_medical 
This medical script for FiveM, built for the ox_core framework, allows players to experience realistic death and injury in the game. When a player's health reaches zero, they will be incapacitated and unable to move until they are revived by another player or by a medical NPC. Reviving a player will require the use of medical equipment such as defibrillators or first aid kits. In addition, players will have the option to apply bandages and other medical items to wounds in order to slow down bleeding and prevent further injury. The script also allows for different levels of injury, such as broken bones and internal bleeding, which will affect the player's movement and abilities until they are treated. Overall, this script adds a heightened level of immersion and realism to the game by forcing players to make strategic decisions and take responsibility for their own survival.
